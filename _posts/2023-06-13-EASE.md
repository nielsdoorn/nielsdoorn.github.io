The EASE conference is hosted this year in Oulu, Finland. Although I did not submit a paper to this conference, I attend it because I am one of the organizers of the Workshop on evaLuation and assEssment on softwARe eNgineers' Education and tRaining (LEARNER 2023) workshop. This first edition of the workshop will have a special theme of Software Testing Education and Training. This is very relevant for my research. One of the things I want to study are learning outcomes of software testing. Learning outcomes can be used to create instructional designs starting from the end: what should a student know, what skills should a student posses and what attitude belongs to that. Students can than be assessed based on these learning outcomes. I am very curious about what will be presented.
