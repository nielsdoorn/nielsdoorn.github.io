Nothing is better to do some writing than the peace and quiet of the Island of [Schiermonnikoog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiermonnikoog). I've rented an AirBnB in the middle of the only village on the island. All I do is sleep, eat, write and repeat and every day I go for a run. Unfortunately, this will not last forever, I arrived yesterday and I will leave on Tuesday.

The things I am going to work on are:

- The design of the serious game on testing
- Setting up a panel discussion on Test Informed Learning with Examples
- Design of the continuation of the study with test experts
