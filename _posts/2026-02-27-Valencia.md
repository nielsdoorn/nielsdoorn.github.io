Last week was my final working week at NHL Stenden. 
Since I want to finish my thesis before I start working at my new job at the University of Applied Sciences Iselinge, and I have about 5 weeks in between, I decided to spend two weeks in Valencia to work on my thesis.

This is the fifth day of my first week here. I have been mostly working on my Systematic Literature Review (SLR), which is coming along nicely. I believe I am almost done!

Next week I'll try to work on the methodology part of the thesis and on the puzzle study, for which I need to analyse the data collected from the sessions with the students and with the experts.
