# From Rationalism to Empiricism in Software Testing Education Through Gamification

On the [INTED2024](http://https://iated.org/inted/) conference I presented our work on developing a serious game to improve software testing education. The presentation can be downloaded [here](/INTED2024.pdf), and the paper can be found [here](/109071.pdf).

My presentation was part of the "Computer Science and Cybersecurity Education" session, at the end of the first day of the two day conference. Other presentations included topics on gamification of professional skills, the design of curricula on cyber security and chat bots for first year students. This diverse group made for a nice audience and a positive vibe.

My presentation was at the end of a very intensive but interesting day with lots of presentations on AI, gamification and innovation in education.
