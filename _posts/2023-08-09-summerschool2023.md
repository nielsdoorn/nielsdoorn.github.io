In the second week of July I attended the European Summer School on Science Communication (ES3C) 2023. Together with several other PhD students, we learned and experiences different ways of dealing with communication matters of our science projects. The trainers used very engaging and different ways of educating us, so it was not only interesting content wise, but also for me as an educator. For example, we started with a murder mystery to get to know each other. 

I learned a lot from the media training, especially how to get your point across when being interviewed, despite the interviewer's intentions to make you say something else. Also, how to use social media to get your science results to be used for a wider audience was interesting. Examples of highly effective ways to do this were shown.

The days where fully packed, so I did not get to see much of Frankfurt, where the school was, but I enjoyed being there. I would definitely recommend other PhD student to attend this summer school next year.
