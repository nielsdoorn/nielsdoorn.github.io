Working on the train was very good.
Time passes quickly, the facilities are great, the view is ever changing and the chairs are ideal.
Now, in Linz, I've been working on and off on my paper.
It is never easy to reach the zone in which I am completely focussed for a long period, and wanting to spent time doing interessting other things makes that harder.
I am carving out time each day to do something.
Sometimes more then other times, but at least there is progress.
One time I had a true insight, a moment when everything clicked.
Those are rare moments, and maybe being on holiday helps with this, at least there are much less day-to-day disturbances that require attention.
Live is pretty simple in a small appartment.
Shops are close by, we can rent a bike and go into the old city, and I run every day.
Tommorow is a travel day, we move on to Konstanz in Germany.
