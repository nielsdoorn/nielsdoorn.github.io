# RTC 2023

Last year a colleague and I went to the Romanian Testing Conference 2022 in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. It was a two day event, with one day of tutorials and one day of conference. We really enjoyed the event, and decided to come again this year. But this year, we are more involved, because our proposal for a presentation was accepted! So we get to present on the conference day.

This year, it is a three day event, with more time allocated for tutorials. We are attending two whole day tutorials on testing.

## Day 1: The Exploratory Testing That Catches Bugs! -- Tutorial by Peter Sabev

This tutorial was very interesting. Peter explained what exploratory testing is, what the pros and cons are, and how to do it.
He presented many approaches, tour-based, persona based and De Bono's thinking hats based approaches. It was a very hands-on tutorial, so we got to test a live production system very thoroughly using these approaches. The amount of issues we uncovered was huge.

I really liked the pair-testing way of working. One takes the role of observer and keeps a log of the testing session, and the driver does the testing. This way, both peers can focus on one thing and this reduces the need to keep on switching between testing and logging.

## Day 2: Back to basics tutorial

We attended this tutorial with the idea to see how we can improve our testing education. The idea behind the tutorial was good, however, the tutorial failed to convince in some ways. The concepts explained are relevant, however the examples given are somewhat controversial, and the sheets contained errors.
