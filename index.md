## Niels Doorn, Ph.D. student

My name is Niels Doorn, I work at [NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences](https://nhlstenden.com) as a team leader / lecturer / researcher at the Informatics program in Emmen, The Netherlands, and I am a Ph.D. student at the [Open Universiteit](https://ou.nl). 

### Orcid

My Orcid ID is: [0000-0002-0680-4443](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0680-4443).

### Twitter

I sometimes [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/nielsdoorn) about my research, but more often about other things that interest me or that fill me with wonder. 
I also maintain a [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1356482580627996672?s=20) of software testing research Twitter accounts.
If you know another Twitter account that should be on the list (maybe your own), send me a direct message.

## Focus of my research

Together with other researchers I study improving the teaching of software testing in higher educational computer science programs. We believe that due to the ever gaining importance of software systems in our society, the quality of these systems need to be as high as possible. Of course, this is almost an impossible task given the nature and complexity of software systems. It is therefore important to pay attention to software testing as an integrated part of computer science programs.

In the end, all computer science graduates should be "Test Infected", a term coined by Martin Fowler to describe the intrinsic motivation to not accepting untested software.

## Current work

Currently, I am working on:

- A study in supporting software analysis with visual modelling to improve test case design.
- Structured Development Procedure: a way to follow a rigorous procedure to design specifications and test cases for software.
- Test Informed Learning with Examples: integrating testing into current programming courses in such a way that testing knowledge of students increases without spending more time in total on their courses.
- Open Inf approach on testing. Applying the principles of Growth Mindset on informatics.
- Developing a Python course with testing integrated.
