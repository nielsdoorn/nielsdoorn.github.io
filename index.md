## Niels Doorn, Ph.D. student in Computer Science Education (CSEd)

My name is Niels Doorn, I work at [NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences](https://nhlstenden.com) as a team leader / lecturer / researcher at the Informatics program in Emmen, The Netherlands. I am a Ph.D. student at the [Open Universiteit](https://ou.nl), and this website is about my research into the sensemaking of creating software tests.

### Orcid

My Orcid ID is: [0000-0002-0680-4443](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0680-4443).

### Twitter

I sometimes toot about my research on my mastadon account <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.online/@niels76">@niels76@mastodon.online</a> about my research, but more often about other things that interest me, or that fill me with wonder. 

### GitHub

Some of my projects can be found on [GitHub.com/nielsdoorn](https://github.com/nielsdoorn).

## Focus of my research

Together with other researchers I want to improve the teaching of software testing in higher educational computer science programs. We believe that due to the ever gaining importance of software systems in our society, the quality of these systems need to be as high as possible. Of course, this is almost an impossible task given the nature and complexity of software systems. It is therefore important to pay attention to software testing education.

My research is in Computer Science Education to gain insights into students' sensemaking of test case design to be able to design a teaching-learning strategy that supports students to learn exploratory and model based software testing which:

- works in different educational contexts
- is integrable in existing courses
- can be taught from the start of the program

In the end, all computer science graduates should be ["Test Infected"](http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm), a term coined by Martin Fowler to describe the intrinsic motivation to not accept untested software.

For this research, I am using Design Research in Education.

## Current work

Currently, I am working on:

- studying the sensemaking approaches of students while modelling test cases
- researching the effects of introducing testing early, seamlessly and subtle in existing courses
- designing experiments to understand misconceptions in testing by students
- designing experiments to gain an initial insight into the possible effects of biases in testing

## Academic services

I find it important to contribute to our academic society. I am also looking at reviewing opportunities and guiding master students.

### Current work

Currently, I am participating in the following items:

- I am lecturing the LaTeX course at Open Universiteit
- I am one of three PhD students who lecture the testing workshop at the Open Universiteit Informatics gatherings
- I am a member of the organizing committee of [NIOC 2023](http://nioc.nl).
- And one of the student competition chairs of [A-Test 2022](https://a-test.org/).
 
### Past work

Previously I have played an active role in the following items:

- I did a poster presentation at the inauguration of [Dr. Migchiel van Diggelen](https://www.nhlstenden.com/onderzoek/dr-migchiel-van-diggelen) (website in Dutch).
- And I was one of the two student volunteer chairs for the [15th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST) 2022](https://icst2022.vrain.upv.es/).
